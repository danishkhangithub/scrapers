You can buy gold, silver, platinum, etc. from major online bullion dealers like JM Bullion, Apmex, Silver.com , etc. You can also buy from your local coin shops, or from eBay (although you have to be somewhat careful about eBay due to the risk of fraud and counterfeiting).

I prefer American Eagles and Buffalos but also have Maple Leafs and Krugerands. The best price (lowest premiums) are from my Local Coin Shop, they are always used but usually in excellent condition. Nowadays the selection is usually very limited but is constantly changing. Visit your local coin stores, talk to the owners, you will see who you like and trust the most. I call my favorite shop sometimes to see what they have, they will put it aside for me, otherwise it may be gone by the time I get there. The market is hot!",
    "Assuming that you can verify that the gold is real, the values should be equal baring damage or wear. It is my experience that pawn shops and coin shops are more expensive than online bullion dealers (barring maybe Apmex) best advice is just to have a way to verify what you are getting.",
    "Thats fair enough... ive started buying off bullionbypost in the uk and its small new bars for now untill i can shop about for other suppliers. As far as im aware they are reputable and trust worthy so im almost confident it will be real and i bought new also as they come in nifty little sealed packing and so on.. Although i have seen some soverigns in my local pawn shop that ranged from just under \u00a3100 to around \u00a3360"

    "Can someone ELI5 for an economics noob ?",
    "The biggest problem with the gold standard was that if you wanted a bunch of money for something, you had to have the actual gold on hand or your money was suddenly worthless. For normal day to day business that was restricting, you actually needed a somewhat balanced budget. It really started to hurt however when it came to waging war. War is expensive! And it was getting much more so in the 20th century. It was no longer about just a musket and supplies each soldier needed. Now we were getting into bigger guns, tanks, airplanes... As the different kinds of weapons of war increased so did the cost. And this was the reason why many empires collapsed. It's hard to make farmers suddenly produce gold when it comes time to wage war.",
    "So we moved to a Fiat currency. That's a type of money that only holds value because people believe in it. It is backed not with gold, but the actual holdings of the government and the belief that it's issuing government would stay strong and in turn lend strength to the value of that currency. This type of money has it's own different set of issues. It isn't limited to physically needing the gold there to make more. However if you make too much, you can fall into the trap of inflation, or even hyper inflation. Inflation like what is currently happening in the United States is when the \"cost\" of everything goes up fairly significantly over a short period of time. When the value of a home goes up, typically people are happy, \"Yeay!!! My house is worth more now!\" They can still buy everything else at roughly the same value, but if they decide to sell their house, they can now afford more, 'other stuff'.  When the value of everything goes up, what's happening is it's the actual dollars value that is falling. The same dollar today, buys less square footage of house vs what it could yesterday. It also buys less wood, less candy, and a smaller car. It isn't that the price for everything goes up, it's that the value of the dollar falls.",
    "That's about how I'd explain it to my 6 year old, and there's a lot more depth that goes into each aspect of this, but it's a bit more accurate than the other big comment explaining things for you I saw.",
    "Basically, afaik, all the countries that were on the gold standard used an exchange rate that had a fixed price for gold and then your individual country\u2019s money was valued against that based upon the price of gold for you. So if in country X gold is $10/oz, but in country Y it\u2019s $15/oz they\u2019d say that that $10 from X is worth $15 from Y, so one X dollar is worth one and a half Y dollars.",
    "This had a limiting effect on the governments ability to just add or remove money to/from the economy to fight inflation, as adding more money, or reducing it, would affect the price of gold and thus the value of your country\u2019s money against everyone else\u2019s. Now it is more a free floating value that I don\u2019t pretend to understand.",
    "The pro of the gold standard was a more stable economy, the pro to leaving the gold standard is the government having more control over the economy with fewer repercussions than before.",
    "I\u2019m sure I got this wrong, but fortunately that usually brings out the Redditor who really knows the stuff.",
    "Real means it's adjusted for inflation. Real wages vs real earnings: earnings is take home and wages is full compensation. So all benefits including things like Healthcare go into wages, but not earnings. CPI means they're using purchasing power to adjust for inflation, where as the gdp deflator is based on something else (maybe productivity, not sure).",
    "I think OP is trying to make some ignorant attack on fiat currency, but whatever.",
    "One important take away here is that it shows fairly well why the \"wages in the US have stagnated\" argument isn't true.",
    "For one, earnings are not wages. The ballooning costs of other benefits (like our out of control healthcare) are eating up potential earnings. Secondly people are adjusting for inflation 2 different ways and comparing, which is wrong and gives you widely different adjustments. When you adjust wages in the same way you adjust productivity (like gdp here), wages and gdp map much more closely.",

Tying your currency to a limited commodity is a recipe for deflation. Are there issues with modern currencies? Sure, but they're not going to get fixed by going back to the good standard.",

    "Under the gold standard the US dollar was overvalued, which led to inflated standards of living. The US gold reserves had dropped by more than half during the 1960s. It was unsustainable.",
    "I doubt things would have turned out much better if the US had just devalued the US dollar relative to gold (which was done, but only half measures before being dropped) as that still would have led to a relative drop in wages. There were also a lot more forces at play, such as the rise of neoliberal economic policies, dismantling of unions, increased foreign competition, etc.",
    "Not to mention that women began to enter the workforce in large numbers. Real GDP per FTE continuing to go up while real wage per worker bogs down is exactly what you'd expect to see with a large increase in the labor pool."

Local government backed bullion on the other hand is often more expensive with higher premiums but they\u2019re always in high demand so coin shops will happily buy them off you.
